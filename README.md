# Cretan, a Remote Logging Service

Cretan provides a generic API that application developers can use to send log
messages to any networked device using a variety of protocols and media.

Cretan is in development, but the plan currently is to support the Discord API,
so that you can send messages to a Discord server. This is a misuse of the
power provided by the Cretan API, and eventually, users will be able to route
messages to devices (servers, android apps, etc.) using:

* Other RESTful APIs
* HTTPS
* MQTT
* UDP

When the MVP is ready for release, this README will be updated.
